# Direct Fourier Transformation of Atom probe data

This program is written to perform a 3D Direct Fourier Transformation (**no** Fast Fourier) of atom probe data.  
The source file (usually ending `.pos`) will be read as 32bit big endian binary numbers with this structure:  
`<X Coord.> <Y Coord.> <Z Coord.> <mass>`

If a correct backup was found it will usually restart from the backup data.

The result is a reciprocal lattice with the log10 of the intensity.  
Exported as a 32bit big endian binary file with the file ending .pos and this format:  
`<X Coord.> <Y Coord.> <Z Coord.> <log10 of intensity>`

For more help start the program over the terminal with `-help`.
